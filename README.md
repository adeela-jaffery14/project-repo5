Demo Project# 5

This project is about how to make an image which is blurry in the beginning to turn fully clear. The opposite for the loading percentage and its div. It's fully visible in the beginning until it gradually fades, and eventually disappears. It was done using a function found on stackoverflow.com to map numbers to each other. 

Thank you for viewing this project.
